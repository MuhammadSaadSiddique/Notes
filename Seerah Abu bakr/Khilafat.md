SAWW is khalil of Allah
Umar RA apologize for his words and say these are my words. ask everyone to give bayah on hand of Abu bakr. he first do this then other sahaba do bayah

Bayah is finalize deal between two side and do this by shaking hand. it is two way promise.
major bayah is on khilafah and minor on other.
bayah is some thing if u enter u cannot leave until rest of life.
