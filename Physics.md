_[Quran 69:38-39](https://www.quranwow.com/#/ch/69/t1/ar-allah/t2/en-itania/a1/alafasy-64/a2/itania-48-b/v/38)_

_I swear by what you see, and by what you do not see._

٣٨ فَلَا أُقْسِمُ بِمَا تُبْصِرُونَ

٣٩ وَمَا لَا تُبْصِرُونَ


1. In order to talk about the nature of the universe and to discuss questions such as whether it has a beginning or an end, you have to be clear about what a scientific theory is. I shall take the simpleminded view that a theory is just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model to observations that we make. It exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality (whatever that might mean). A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. For example, Aristotle believed Empedocles’s theory that everything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water. This was simple enough, but did not make any definite predictions. On the other hand, Newton’s theory of gravity was based on an even simpler model, in which bodies attracted each other with a force that was proportional to a quantity called their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Yet it predicts the motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets to a high degree of accuracy.
2. The dance of atoms, planets, and galaxies resonates with the divine order set by Allah. Through Tawaf, you become part of this celestial symphony, with the call for Divine System echoing the need to align human existence with the cosmic choreography.
