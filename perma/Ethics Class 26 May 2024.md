Behavior of a natural occurrence is constant then it can be called law. for eg Sun shines, earth revolving, 
law of motion
	object at rest remain at rest until someone put pressure on it.  same for object in motion.

qanoon ka italaq hota hai
assool ko raij kiya jata hai

ethics is set of laws and principles
	law is contant behaviour (time)  natural/ devine
	principals are practice (condition)

morals are code of conduct
	code is set of rules and regulation
	non beliver has no link with moral only link when match with certain rules
	moral= {code, conduct}
	rules are faith/ beliefs
Latin saying
Salvation of people lies an absolute justice
 absolute justice is 
fundamental of a certain belief
if ethics is law and principle
then moral is super set of Ethics
when fundamental equals to BELIEF


non believer
universal ethics are we dont bend any laws/ principle
unbiased fact finding comprehension every term
surah taha ayat 50 
insaan 3
yunas 108
rule come from fundamental
rule means it is defined somewhere eg PPC. Shariah

law is qanoon
regulation is zabta


when 2 realities intersect become fact
2 fact intersect become truth
2 truth intersect become universal truth
