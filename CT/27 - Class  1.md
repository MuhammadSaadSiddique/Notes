Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, one of you will be confronted by Satan and he will say: Who created you? Then he says: Allah. Satan says: Who created Allah? If one of you feels that, let him recite: I have faith in Allah and His Messengers. This will take him away.”
