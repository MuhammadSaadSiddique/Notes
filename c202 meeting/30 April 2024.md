confidence comes from Latin, specifically the noun confīdentia from the verb confīdere “to confide.” The Latin prefix con-, a variant of com-, usually means “with; together; in combination,” but here it is an intensive prefix meaning “completely”; the verb fīdere means “to trust.” The related Latin noun fidēs “trust” is the ultimate source of the English word faith. Confidence entered English in the 14th century.

Middle English (as a noun in the sense ‘worth, reputation’): from Old French estime (noun), estimer (verb), from Latin aestimare ‘to estimate’. The verb was originally in the Latin sense, also ‘appraise’ (compare with estimate), used figuratively to mean ‘assess the merit of’. Current senses date from the 16th century.


confidence is to do a stuff after multiple attempts.

hzrat yaqoob as ne yousaf as ki self esteem ko develop kia tu unhon ne apni self worth recognize ki or isi wjah se itni problems bhi face kr lin so we can say that self esteem pivots on ones inherent sense of self worth regardless of outcomes(means not based on how many times someone suceeded or fail at something)
